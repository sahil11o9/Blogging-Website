            I’m sick of lists of habits that are unrealistic for the majority of
            people. Even worse is when someone says to wake up at 5 am or run 10
            kilometers every day and calls it a micro-habit. This is not one of
            those lists. Each micro-habit here takes one minute at most each day
            or uses a task most people do anyway. None of them will transform or
            revolutionize your life but they can help you live a little bit
            better every day and this adds up over time. I draw on the research
            by BJ Fogg in “Tiny Habits” and the Japanese concept of kaizen. When
            each task is so small it’s hard to skip it so there’s no need for
            willpower. The beauty of this is after some time it becomes a
            natural part of your daily routine so you’re acting in your best
            interests without even realizing it! I’ve avoided fluffy ideas and
            stuck to things I have done in my own life where I can find good
            research backing. Don’t try to do everything on this list at once
            but pick the ones you think will work for you. Later you can come
            back for more or create your own to suit your lifestyle. Here we go!
